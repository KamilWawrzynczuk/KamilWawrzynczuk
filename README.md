## Hi, i am Kamil Wawrzy≈Ñczuk.

### This is a little bio about me and why i am learning coding.

I used to organize music and theater festivals and I loved it. On the other hand I always wanted to use skills that I gained after graduating university with a master degree in mathematics and computer science.

I already had a little bit of experience in coding, design, motion graphics and I always thought that this feeling after solving coding problems is so satisfying. So I decided to enroll for a 1 year long bootcamp to become a Full-Stack Developer.

I like to make new designs. Seeing them change on different devices still looks very nice. Solving logical and technical problems. Finishing other amazing courses and getting less confused every day!

Now I am working with:
```HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, TypeScript, Git/Github, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB.```

Still a long way in front of me but it is so good to make this one small step every day.
