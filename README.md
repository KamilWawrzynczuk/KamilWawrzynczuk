## Hi, i am Kamil Wawrzy≈Ñczuk.

Web Developer with a master's degree in mathematics, background in graphic design and a graduate of a one-year intensive Full Stack Development course, so I bring a unique blend of analytical thinking and creative flair to my work. 

Currently working as a full time Frontend Developer.
