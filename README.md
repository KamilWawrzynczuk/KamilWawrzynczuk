## Hi, i am Kamil Wawrzy≈Ñczuk.

Goal oriented Fullstack Web Developer
with experience in graphic design and
event management.
Soon graduating from a one-year long
intensive course in Fullstack
Development.
Looking forward to combining my work
experience and knowledge to solve
challenging problems and offer long
term solutions.


I used to organize music and theater festivals and I loved it. On the other hand I always wanted to use skills that I gained after graduating university with a master degree in mathematics and computer science.

I already had a little bit of experience in coding, design, motion graphics and I always thought that this feeling after solving coding problems is so satisfying. So I decided to enroll for a 1 year long bootcamp to become a Full-Stack Developer.

I like to make new designs. Seeing them change on different devices still looks very nice. Solving logical and technical problems. Finishing another amazing courses and getting new konwledge every day!

Now I am working with:
```HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS,  React, TypeScript, Git/Github, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB.```
